# tic-tac-toe
game tic tac toe

The game uses a deck of cards of two colors. At the beginning of the game, the participants choose their color and receive five cards. On his turn, the player puts one card on the table, and then draws a new card from the deck. In this case, you can either lay out one card on the table, or put your card on another card that is already on the table, but only if the numbers of these cards match, or play a return card. This is a special card that gives the right to remove any card from the table.
Laying out cards, each player seeks to collect a row of cards of his color, while trying to prevent his opponent from doing the same. The game resembles "tic-tac-toe" in that the cards are laid out in an imaginary square of three by three cards. But unlike "tic-tac-toe", players have the ability to constantly change the situation, using return cards or covering the opponent's cards.
Purpose of the game
For each row collected, the player receives one token. The winner is the one with the most tokens.
